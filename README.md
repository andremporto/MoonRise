# MoonRise

A beautiful App we’re going to build an app that lets users learn about the missions and astronauts that formed NASA’s Apollo space program.

## Our Goal

To get more experience with Codable, but more importantly you’ll also work with scroll views, navigation, and much more interesting layouts..

## What I learn

- GeometryReader.
- AspectRatio(contentMode: .resize).
- Codable.
- JSON data.
- Basic debugging.

…and more.
